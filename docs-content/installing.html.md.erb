##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Weave Cloud for PCF

**1.** Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-weave).

**2.** Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

**3.** Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of Weave Cloud for PCF.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

**4.** Click the newly added Weave Cloud for PCF tile.

**5.** Assign availability zones and networks in the tile settings tab:

Once these are configured, decide whether you want to configure the tile to use [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works) or whether you want to run a stand-alone version inside your own cloud and use [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/oss/scope/).

Note that with Weave Cloud you can use both Prometheus montoring and the explore features, whereas, with Weave Scope you can only to explore your application.

**4.** Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Apply Changes**.

**5.** Once the service token is entered and saved in the PCF Ops Manager, return to Weave Cloud and click **Explore**, where you should see something similar to the screen capture shown below:

### <a id="wc-scope"></a>Installing Weave Scope Standalone

As an alternative to integrating with Weave Cloud, you can deploy an instance of the Weave Scope App inside your own cloud. To do this, leave the **Weave Cloud Service Token** field empty and then select **Resource Config** and set the number of Weave Scope App instances to one or more.

Once you've made your changes to the tile configuration, remember to click the **Apply Changes** in Ops Manager.

### <a id="authorize"></a>Authorizing the Weave Scope Standalone App

The standalone Scope App integrates with Cloud Foundryâ€™s User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server. In order to use the app, login as a cloud_controller.admin user and authorize Weave Scope.

If the PCF tile is configured to work with [Weave Cloud](https://cloud.weave.works), you can explore your Cloud Foundry deployment by logging into your Weave Cloud account and clicking the Explore tab.
